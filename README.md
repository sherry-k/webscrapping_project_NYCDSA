# Web Scrapping Project For NYC Data Science Academy

For this project I wanted to find out the relationship between the transfer spending of English Premier League Clubs
and their league position. Does spending more money guarantee success ?

I used scrappy to scrape http://transfermarkt.co.uk/ to get data about how much clubs have spent over the past 20 years
and how they have faired in the league (points, position, goal difference).
